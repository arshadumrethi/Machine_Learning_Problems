The Kaggle Halloween challenge is a challenge where you are given text sample from various horror genre fiction books. 
However these sample are from a list of 3 authors only. 
The goal of the challenge is to classify the test set of text samples their respective predicted author. 

Since this requires the analysis of large blocks of text this challenge is interesting. 

I initally started to approach this problem as a textbook classification problem and tried to use decision trees. 

However this approach did not work very well. 

As I iterate my approach and try other things I will update my scripts here.
